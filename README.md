<h1>FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM</h1>

<p>
With this system customers can order food and make payments. The front-end of the system is coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end is coded using PHP.
I implemented all back-end parts including login and customer registration and front-end of the admin dashboard and shopping cart. This system includes a admin dashboard.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Admin can add food items. </li>
 <li>Admin can remove food items from the customerâ€™s view using admin panel. </li>
 <li>Admin can hold the food items viewing to customers </li>
 <li>Admin can edit and delete existing food items by using admin panel.</li>
</ul>
